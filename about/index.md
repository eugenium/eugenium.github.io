I graduated from [Stuyvesant High School](stuy.edu) and received my Bachelor and Master's degree from the [Cooper Union](www.cooper.edu) in Electrical Engineering. Before starting my PhD I worked for several years as a research-oriented Software Engineer at [International Biometrics Group](https://www.novetta.com/). I have also previously worked as Network Software Developer.When I am not working I like to bike, play chess, and travel.
