 # My past research has spanned many areas in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Graphical Models. My PhD thesis developed several machine learning methods that exploit sparse underlying graph structure in applications with limited sample setting such as those found in the analysis of neuro-imaging. During my PhD I have also worked on a broad scope of problems from deep generative modeling, multi-modal learning, bayesian optimization, and large scale image recognition and detection.

I am an Assistant Professor at [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/ginacody/computer-science-software-eng.html) and [Mila](https://mila.quebec/). Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Mila](https://mila.quebec/) and  at the University of Montreal working with [Aaron Courville](https://mila.quebec/en/person/aaron-courville/). I completed a (joint) PhD at CentraleSupelec, University of Paris-Saclay  and KU Leuven ([VISICS](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/psi/visics)) supervised by [Matthew Blaschko](http://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~mblaschk/). During my PhD I also visited the University of Toronto Machine Learning Group working with [Richard Zemel](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~zemel), and [Raquel Urtasun](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~urtasun/) and interned in the core machine learning groups at Apple (with Tomas Pfister) and at Amazon (with Matthias Seeger). 

Some of my current research interests include continual and online deep learning, sample efficient deep learning, and (scalable) alternative training methods for deep networks. I am also intrested in problems at the intersection of computer vision and language, particularly visual relation discovery and reasoning (with applications in e.g. VQA), and instruction following agents in 3D environments.
