I am second year PhD student at the [Center for Visual Computing](http://cvn.ecp.fr/) at  Ecole Centrale Paris and also a member of the INRIA Galen team. I am also concurrently doing a joint PhD at KU Leuven  [VISICS](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/psi/visics) lab. I am supervised by [Matthew Blaschko](http://pages.saclay.inria.fr/matthew.blaschko/).

My primary research interests are in Machine Learning, Graphical Models, Statistics in High Dimensions and Neural Networks. On the application side I work/have worked on Neuro-imaging, Computer Vision, Biometrics, and Speech Recognition.
