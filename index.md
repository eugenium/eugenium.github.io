From July I will be a Postdoctoral Felllow at Montreal Institute of Learning Algorithms at the University of Montreal. I recently completed my PhD jointly at CentraleSupelec and KU Leuven supervised by [Matthew Blaschko](http://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~mblaschk/). During my PhD I primarily worked at the [Center for Visual Computing](http://cvn.ecp.fr/) and was also part of the [VISICS](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/psi/visics) lab. My PhD thesis developed several machine learning methods with applications in limited sample setting such as those found in the analysis of neuro-imaging. During my PhD I have also had the great pleasure to work extensively on a broad scope of problems in Machine Learning, from deep generative modeling, more efficient large scale image recognition, multi-modal learning, bayesian optimization, as well as work towards better understanding of deep learning. 



During my PhD I have had the great pleasure to work with a lot of awesome co-authors and collaborators including [Edouard Oyallon](http://www.di.ens.fr/~oyallon/), [Gael Varoquaux](http://gael-varoquaux.info/), [Andreas Argyriou](http://cvn.ecp.fr/personnel/andreas/), [Arthur Gretton](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~gretton/), [Wacha Bounliphone](https://sites.google.com/site/wachabounliphone/),[Kyle Kastner](https://kastnerkyle.github.io/) , [Jamie Kiros](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rkiros/), [Richard Zemel](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~zemel), and [Raquel Urtasun](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~urtasun/)

My primary research interests are in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Graphical Models.
