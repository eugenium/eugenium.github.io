I am currently recruiting PhD and Msc students. Please send me an informal inquriy if you are interested with your CV and optionally a short (1 page max) description of motivations and research interests. In your email subject please put \[Recruiting\]


Below I provide an idea and some references for general areas I am currently looking for students in, however I am also open to supervising student proposals in other projects in Computer Vision and Machine Learning. 


*Continual learning, online deep learning, and few shot learning*
An exciting open question in deep learning is how to effectively learn in online and non-stationary settings. Continual learning aims to learn new tasks (with potentially few samples) while retaining knowledge of old tasks. 


*Vision and Language*
I am interested in computer vision problems at the intersection of natural language processing (for example VQA, Embodied QA)


*Alternative Training of Deep Networks* 
I am interested in developing novel and scalable methods for training deep networks that have improved speed, convergence, simpler parallelization or hardware implementation, online learning, and/or forgetting. Some related publications to give a flavor.
