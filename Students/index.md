**Recruiting**
I am recruiting motivated PhD students as well as graduate student interns/visitors (PhD or senior/graduating MS students).  Note I am not be able to respond to all emails. Students should demonstrate strong programming and math skills. Previous research experience, particularly in machine learning is a plus.
