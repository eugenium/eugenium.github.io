I am currently recruiting motivated PhD and Msc students. Please send me an informal inquiry to (belilove@mila.quebec) if you are interested with your CV and optionally a short (1 page max) description of motivations and research interests. In your email subject please put \[Recruiting\]. Note I am not be able to respond to all emails. Below I provide an idea and some references for general areas I am currently looking for students in, however I am open to supervising student proposals in other projects in Machine Learning and Computer Vision. 



**Research Projects**

*Continual learning, online deep learning, and few shot learning*

An exciting open question in deep learning is how to effectively learn in online and non-stationary settings. Continual learning aims to learn new tasks (with potentially few samples) while retaining knowledge of old tasks. A few related publications:

-Aljundi, Caccia, Belilovsky, Caccia et al Online Continual Learning with Maximally Interferred Retrieval  <br>
-Caccia, Belilovsky et al Online Learned Continual Compression with Adaptive Quantization Modules<br>
-Hu et al Drinking from a Firehose: Continual Learning with Web-scale Natural Language<br>
-Lin et al Conditional Computation for Continual Learning



*Vision and Language*

I am interested in computer vision problems at the intersection of natural language processing (for example VQA, Embodied QA)



*Alternative Training of Deep Networks*

I am interested in developing novel and scalable methods for training deep networks that have improved speed, convergence, simpler parallelization or hardware implementation, online learning, and/or forgetting. Some related publications to give a flavor.
