I am always on the lookout for strong PhD students interested interested to work on a variety of topics in Deep Learning. 

Currently I am particularly recruiting motivated PhD, interns, and Masterâ€™s students  to work on projects in distributed deep learning methods and federated learning. Students should have strong programming skills and familiarity with deep learning methods and demonstrate genuine interest in the research topic. If contacting about this opportunity put [ReadWebsite] in your email title.
