**Prediction and Recovery With Smooth, Sparse, and Correlated Signals**

In this project we develop a method for recovering and predicting from signals that have certain structured sparsity  constraints. Such an approach can be advantageous in Neuro-imaging where the data has few samples, many parameters, yet we can make underlying assumptions. We use a discrete formulation of the constraints and study the properties of a relaxation. We proposed a tractable approximation with guarantees and apply it to several interesting problems including images and prediction in fMRI data.
