In general, I am always on the lookout for strong PhD students. Students should have strong programming skills, some existing research experience, and familiarity with deep learning methods. You should take a look at some of my papers before contacting me. 


Currently I am recruiting motivated Masterâ€™s students, interns and/or PhD students who can start in the short term to work on specific project areas below (with some related papers given to give you an idea of the project).  If contacting about this opportunity put [ReadWebsite] in your email title.
